ABSTRACT 

An airline management system is a database management system (DBMS) mini-project that aims to automate and streamline various processes related to airline operations. This system would store and manage data such as flight schedules, passenger information, ticket prices, and booking information, as well as provide a user-friendly interface for customers to book and manage their flights. Additionally, the system would also include features such as flight scheduling and tracking, inventory management, and financial reporting. The system can connect airport management systems to provide more accurate and relevant information to the passengers and the management.
Overall, the goal of this mini-project is to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience for an airline.
